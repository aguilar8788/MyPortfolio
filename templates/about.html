            <p>
                I am a developer from Detroit, MI (currently living in Denver, CO).
                I am passionate about web development, and I love all aspects
                of the development process. I am addicted to learning, and get excited about new technologies. I have 4 years of front end experience,
                and 1 year of back end experience. I pride my self on my work ethic, and on being reliable.
